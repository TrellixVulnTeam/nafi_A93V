# a track is defined as follows:
#
#	track=PATH1, PATH2... : ROW1, ROW2, ROW3......
# 
# A [PATH] sequence is separated from a [ROW] sequence by a colin [:]
# In a sequence, PATHs and ROWs are separated by a coma.
#
# When a track contains multiple PATHs, they all share the same number of ROWs
# The example above is equivalent to:
#
#	track1=PATH1 : ROW1, ROW2, ROW3......
#	track2=PATH2 : ROW1, ROW2, ROW3......
#
# Whitespaces are ignored, but can be used for legibility.
